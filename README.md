#cool.vim

A simple basic syntax highlighting plugin for the lenguage COOL (Classroom Object Oriented Language).

## Installation

### Making Vim recognize cool files
Since cool is a small and not a very popular lenguage (because it is mostly use for educational purposes), it is very likely that vim may not recognize cool file types. So we will add them.

```bash
#Adding ftdetect folder inside the .vim directory
mkdir -p ~/.vim/ftdetect/ 

#Adding .cl file type
cd ~/.vim/ftdetect/
touch cool.vim && printf "au BufRead,BufNewFile *.cl set filetype=cl" >> cool.vim
```

Add file type detection to the '.vimrc' file
```vim
set filetype
```

### Plugin installation

For vim-plug

```vim
Plug 'EJ-PJ/cool.vim'
```

For other plugin managers it should be installed in the manner they require
